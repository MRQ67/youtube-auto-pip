# Icons Directory

This directory should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:
- icon16.png (16x16)
- icon32.png (32x32)
- icon48.png (48x48)
- icon128.png (128x128)

The icons should represent the YouTube Auto PiP extension concept, possibly incorporating:

- Simple, recognizable design that works at small sizes

To create these icons, you can:
1. Use an icon generator tool like https://favicon.io/
2. Design them manually using graphic design software
3. Use AI image generation tools with appropriate prompts
